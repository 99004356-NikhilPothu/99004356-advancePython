## Used Tools
    Pycharm
    Pytest-testing
    Pylint- Code analysis
## Implementation
 ![Flowchart](https://github.com/99004356-NikhilPothu/99004356-advancePython/blob/master/Images/Flowchart.png)

At first, I have created a Excel file naming main.xlsx and in that I have created five sheets.
My main aim is to access requested data from the sheets and display on new excel.
1. From the flowchart you can see that when a persson executes the file it asks name of the person and creates a new excel file.
2. After creating new excel file it asks whether you want to access data or not.
3. if you enter 1 then it will continue to further steps else it terminates
4. Then displays the available sheets, and the user as to select from which sheet he want to access data
5. It displays Available PS-numbers(unique).
6. User need to select the interested PS-Number to display data in to the excel sheet
7. After that it again asks if he need more data and repeats the process from point 3.
